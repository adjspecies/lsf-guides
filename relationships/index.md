title: The Love ◦ Sex ◦ Fur Guide to Relationships
---

Welcome to the **<span class="titlefont">Love ◦ Sex ◦ Fur</span> Guide
to Relationships**! Our goal is to provide a simple guide to help you
explore and enjoy relationships both inside and outside the furry
fandom. We'll be covering the topics of relationship status within the
furry fandom, polyamory, online and long distance relationships,
communication, and sex and intimacy. This guide will be available online
in a mobile-friendly format, as well as in print so that it's always
there to be referenced.

### Relationship status of the fandom

**Furry is fairly diverse when it comes to relationship status.**
However, according to the 2013 Furry Survey \[<span
id="deref1">[1](#ref1)</span>\], the majority of furries are single:

| <!----> | <!----> |
|---|---|
| Single | *55.6%* |
| Long-term relationship |*21.8%* |
| Casual Relationship | *12.8%* |
| Marriage or other permanent commitment | *6.8%* |

This is as compared to the *44%* of Americans who report being single
\[<span id="deref2">[2](#ref2)</span>\]. Additionally, *71.4%* of
furries who report being in a relationship report that their partner is
also a furry, meaning that it is far more common for furries to date
within the fandom, rather than outside the furry subculture.

**Polyamory and open relationships** also figure large within the furry
fandom:

|---|---|
| Sexually open | *19.7%* |
| Sexually closed | *80.3%* |
| Romantically open | *30.7%* |
| Romantically closed | *69.3%* |

Like orientation, polyamory is a variable scale of comfort that each
individual has: some people do not feel comfortable with polyamory at
all and have strictly monogamous relationships, while others do not feel
comfortable in monogamous relationships and may maintain multiple
relationships with various people throughout their life, often at the
same time. This is a topic exceeding the bounds of this guide, but will
be touched on throughout.

Finally, **orientation and gender** do play a role in furry
relationships. Although the fandom is made up of members of all
different identities, from completely homosexual to completely
heterosexual, the fandom is also made up of primarily those who are
male. This means that those who identify as bisexual or pansexual are
more likely to wind up in a male-male relationship, thus the perceived
prevalence of homosexuality within the furry subculture.

### Online and long distance relationships

One salient feature of relationships within furry, due to the
decentralized nature of the fandom, is just how many of them are long
distance or based primarily on online interaction. There are both
upsides and downsides to these types of relationships:

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| It's easier to find a partner or partners who shares an interest in the furry subculture, meaning that you automatically have something to talk about and a framework in which you can interact. | Perhaps most obviously, the lack of direct contact when one might need it most. You are dependent on your partner or partners being online or within reach of a phone to talk. |
| Interacting online with your partner is a good way to interact in a way that feels true to yourself as you ideally want to be, as the character you have made to represent yourself. You can construct your responses all the more carefully when interacting online. | There is some financial burden involved in structuring in-person visits, in situations where that's practical at all. Travel costs can be prohibitive, and meeting at conventions can be stressful. |
| A relationship online during the early years in one's adult life might be the safest and most stable relationship that one can have: it can last through moves and school without having to change much, and can offer support in life situations where such relationships would not otherwise be possible. | It can be difficult to explain your relationship status to those around you such as friends and family. Long-distance and online relationships are still a relatively new idea in society at large. |

It's worth noting that these relationships, despite their pros and cons,
are still just as valid as relationships that aren't long-distance or
based online. If these relationships are the type that work best for you
and your parter or partners, do not let the distance get in the way of
having a happy relationship! You have found something that is worth
holding onto!

#### On meeting up

Meeting with a long-distance partner for the first time can be both
exciting and scary. There's a lot on the line, when it comes to your
relationship, and although you may mesh really well through text or over
the phone, things are always different in person. Make sure to keep an
open mind about your partner - be willing to learn new things about
them, and discover the intricacies of how they interact - and discuss
this ahead of time with them before you meet. There's no telling how
things will be different, but they can be almost guaranteed to be not
quite what everyone was expecting, and that's okay!

You might want to work out a schedule with your partner or partners for
visiting so that you can see each other regularly. Keeping consistency
can play a big role in the stability of a relationship, and anything
that gets in the way of that, such as school, work, or health issues, is
something to be talked through in an open and accepting fashion. Make
sure to keep everyone apprised.

Along with consistency, some variety is also important in order to help
keep things balanced between everyone. Make sure to visit each other,
and to find other places to visit together if at all possible, so that
it isn't always one person visiting the other. Just remember to keep
safe!

#### Shared activities and interests

Conventions
:   Conventions are a natural solution to meeting up with your partner.
    You automatically have stuff to do, you're likely to have mutual
    friends around to keep you company, and travelling together is a
    good way to grow closer. Just remember that conventions can also be
    very stressful events, with a lot going on; take the space you need
    to stay happy and healthy!

Online dates
:   If you can't necessarily meet up in person, you can still do
    things together. Try starting a movie at the same time as your
    partner and hanging out online together so that you can discuss
    what's happening as you both experience it at the same time, or set
    aside time to talk on the phone when you're not distracted by the
    internet and simply catch up.

Playing online
:   Of course, playing online is not to be discounted in our subculture.
    Role play, sexual or otherwise, is a good way to spend time with
    your partner or partners in a way that helps to satisfy interactions
    that go beyond simply talking. As a bonus, sexual role play online
    is a perfectly valid form of safer sex!

### Communication

When in doubt, more is better
:   It's always good to be able to work things out with your partner or
    partners as they come up, and it's good to remember that anything
    that might possibly become an issue is worth talking about. Talk
    about the way you feel about them, talk about the way you feel about
    others, talk about how you feel about how your life is going. It's
    always better, when you get involved with someone, to preempt issues
    rather than to have to worry about damage control down the line!

Arguments and disagreement
:   Arguments will happen, and you will disagree with your partner or
    partners over time - there's no avoiding it, and it's best to
    confront the issues that you run into with a calm attitude and
    open mind. If you run into something that your partner or partners
    are doing that bugs you, bring it up honestly and earnestly, and
    make it understood that something will need to change, even if it's
    you!

Third parties: friends, family, and those around you
:   Talking through your relationship with others around you is a good
    way to get outside input on how things are going. Often, it's easy
    to get into a sort of tunnel-vision about your relationship, so that
    it's hard to see the bigger picture. Your friends, your family, and
    those around you and your partner or partners can help shed some
    light on things.

### Sex and intimacy

Sex and intimacy play a large role in many relationships. Even in
relationships where sex does not figure as large, getting what one needs
in terms of intimacy is important in feeling fulfilled, both for you and
your partner or partners.

#### Safer sex

Safer sex should be practiced even within a relationship. Remember that
you're having sex with your partner, but everyone your partner is
currently and has previously had sex with should be factored into the
risk of unprotected sex. There are a few things you can do to help
mitigate and understand that risk:

Testing
:   Getting tested regularly and sharing your results with your partner
    or partners can help keep all of you informed as to any potential
    risks and anything else you need to be aware of in a sexually
    active relationship.

Fluid bonding
:   If you do decide to have unprotected sex with your partner, you
    might want to consider the idea of becoming "fluid bonded". Fluid
    bonding is a commitment made between you and your partner or
    partners that you will not have unprotected sex with anyone
    except them. This helps minimize the risk of STIs. Note that, in
    polyamorous situations, you should aim to be fluid-bonded to only
    *one* person at a time.

See the safer sex guide
:   There is a whole lot more information about safer sex to be had out
    there, so check up on the [Safer Sex Guide](/safer-sex) as well to
    keep informed about how to be safe while having fun!

#### Needs and wants

As always, much of this comes back to the idea of communication. You
should work on discussing the things that you need and the things that
you want out of your relationship with your partner or parnters

Needs
:   The needs of you and your partner or partners are the things that
    you cannot do without in the context of your relationship. Some
    people need space during stressful times in their lives, while some
    people need additional attention, physical or otherwise, at
    those times. These are the types of things you will need to discuss
    with your partner or partners in order to make sure that everyone
    feels comfortable in the relationship.

Wants
:   Most everything else in your relationship will fall into the
    category of wants. These are the things that would help make your
    relationship better, but without which will not cause damage to what
    you have. For instance, you may want more physical intimacy with
    your partner or partners, but you might still be happy with what you
    are getting.

#### Sexually open relationships

It frequently happens that people who wind up in a relationship together
have different levels of sexual activity, or libidos, than each other.
This type of variance is natural and to be expected with the diversity
of life. At this point, some might consider opening their relationship
up sexually. This is a step that should not be taken lightly, and should
involve a good amount of conversation. You should be prepared to tackle
the issue of jealousy as well as the issues of safer sex and emotional
wellbeing. Discuss why you think this is a step that will benefit
everyone within the relationship, and make sure that, if there is
something that you or your current partner can do to improve things as
well, that that is addressed! Remember, safety in sexual situations is
also about the emotional and mental safety of all involved.
