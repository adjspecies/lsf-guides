This is the general outline used in building Love ◦ Sex ◦ Fur's Guide to gender.
The general point here is to provide a very readable guide to gender that a)
provides accurate information around gender, b) flows well, and c) works well in
both print and online.

### Notes
* Approximately, each top-level bullet point should be  a section; each second
  level bullet point should be a paragraph; each point below that should be a
  sentence or phrase.
* Glossary should remain alphabetical.
