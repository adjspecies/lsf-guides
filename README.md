lsf-guides
==========

Print+Web guides for Love ◦ Sex ◦ Fur.

These are intended to be guides for distribution both through print and online.
The guides can cover any sort of topic in brochure-format that LSF would cover.
The online versions will be in <code>site/</code> and the print versions will be
in <code>print/</code>.

## Contributing

If you have an idea to contribute, please feel free to fork and submit a pull
request!  However, we have a few requests before you do so.

* **Number One Most Important** - Please maintain parity between online and
  print versions of guides if they exist!\*  If you would like to submit an idea 
  only for someone else to write up for you, please only modify the 
  outline.markdown file in the online directory.  This means that, if you want 
  to contribute directly to the guides, you will need to be familiar enough with 
  HTML and Inkscape SVGs to contribute your idea to both!  They should be fairly 
  straight-forward.
* **Number One Point Five Most Important** - Always edit the outline first, even
  if you submit a pull request with changes to print/online versions.  Parity
  applies to the outline as well! Separate bullet point because it's important.
* Please try to maintain maximum column width of 80 characters and indentation
  of 4 spaces within HTML.\*\*  Just keep it clean :o)
* In order to maintain consistency in the printed version, your pull request may
  be rejected with an explanation in a comment rather than an annotation on
  code.  That's the problem with a graphical editor!
* Write up a short description of your changes in the form of a blog-post for
  every pull request, if you can (we will if not), so that the change-log can be
  updated with what you've accomplished!

\* Initial branches won't have this be the case, of course.

\*\* Sensible defaults are included for Vim in the file as such: `textwidth=80
expandtab tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 fo=tc spell`.
