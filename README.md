These are intended to be guides for distribution both through print and online.

in <code>print/</code>.

## Contributing

If you have an idea to contribute, please feel free to fork and submit a pull
request!  However, we have a few requests before you do so.

* **Number One Most Important** - Please maintain parity between online and
  print versions of guides.  If you would like to submit an idea only for
  someone else to write up for you, please only modify the outline.markdown file
  in the online directory.  This means that, if you want to contribute directly
  to the guides, you will need to be familiar enough with HTML and Inkscape SVGs
  to contribute your idea to both!  They should be fairly straight-forward.
* **Number One Point Five Most Important** - Always edit the outline first, even
  if you submit a pull request with changes to print/online versions.  Parity
  applies to the outline as well! Separate bullet point because it's important.
* Please try to maintain maximum column width of 80 characters and indentation
  to the first line (that is, if you have nested lists, indent paragraphs to the
  first character of the first line of the paragraph).  This is just about the
  entirety of the style-guide for text-based stuff.  Just keep it clean :o)
* In order to maintain consistency in the printed version, your pull request may
  be rejected with an explanation in a comment rather than an annotation on
  code.  That's the problem with a graphical editor!
* Write up a short description of your changes in the form of a blog-post for
  every pull request, if you can (we will if not), so that the change-log can be
  updated with what you've accomplished!
