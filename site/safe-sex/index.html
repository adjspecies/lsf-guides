title: The Love &#x25E6; Sex &#x25E6; Fur Guide to Safer Sex

---

<p>Welcome to the <strong><span class="titlefont">Love &#x25E6; Sex &#x25E6;
        Fur</span> Guide to Safer Sex</strong>! Our goal is to provide a simple
manual to help you enjoy a sexual lifestyle that's safe and healthy for both
you and your partner or partners.  We'll be covering the topics of consent,
protection, and contraception in a clear and topical manner to help you make
healthy and informed choices.  This guide will be available online a
mobile-friendly format, as well as available in print so that it's always there
to be referenced.  Additionally, we will endeavor to keep this up to date with
the US Center for Disease Control's information on sexually transmitted
diseases and pregnancy so that we never fall behind.<p>

<h3>Talking About Sex</h3>

<p>Here in the furry subculture, sex and sexuality play a unique role for a few
reasons:
<ul>
    <li><strong>We produce and consume art of all sorts of a sexual
        nature</strong> - visual arts, written erotica, and even videos
    involving live actors in costume.</li>
    <li><strong>We interact with each other through constructed
        characters</strong> - there's more to each fur than meets the eye, as
    many of us interact in the ways in which we choose: through constructed
    characters.</li>
    <li><strong>We are pretty honest about sex and sexuality</strong> - the
    furry subculture is seen by many as a safe space for exploring and
    re-evaluating topics such as sex, sexual orientation, and gender
    identity. [<a href="#ref1" id="deref1">1</a>]</li>
</ul>
Given these reasons, and many more to boot, it's no surprise that the topic of
sex comes up often with regards to furry life and social interaction!</p>

<p>This guide is intended to be a sex-positive map for navigating the waters of
sexuality in the furry fandom.  What is meant by sex-positivity?
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sex-positivity is not hypersexuality</strong> - by providing a
    positive face to sex and sexuality, the goal is not to encourage sex, but to
    encourage acceptance of sex, lack of sex, lots and lots of sex, and all
    different stripes in between.</li>
    <li><strong>A positive and constructive experience</strong> - sex and the
    discussion around sex should always be positive and constructive, never
    shameful or leave one feeling bad about oneself!</li>
    <li><strong>The most important discussion is between you and your partner or
        partners</strong> - guides like this are good at providing you with the
    information you need to have healthy and safe sex, but the ultimate
    conversation should be one that you have with those closest to you!</li>
</ul>
Why do we need a sex-positive guide to safer sex, then?  The goal is simple:
more information is always better.  We here in the fandom have the right and
responsibility to make the best and safest decisions for ourselves in the ways
we interact with each other.  Standing by that principle, guides like this one
right here need to provide accurate and up-to-date information to help make this
conversation possible.</p>

<h3>Consent</h3>

<p>All sexual activity that you share with another person or other people must
involve consent, and that often takes the part of a conversation you have with
someone when you are ready to become intimate with each other.  Consent is,
simply, a willing and mutual agreement to take part in this act together.
However, it's worth dissecting just what that means:
<ul>
    <li><strong>It's voluntary</strong> - consent is never coerced from your
    partner; it's the type of thing that only they can give.</li>
    <li><strong>It's active</strong> - consent means saying yes, even
    enthusiastically!  There should be no doubt that your partner consents!</li>
    <li><strong>It's continual</strong> - it doesn't matter what's gone on
    before between you and your partner: your sexual history, your life history,
    or even what you've done already that evening, consent is given or not for
    everything you do.  If someone says "NO!" then it's time to stop.</li>
</ul>
Without any of these being taken into account, it's not possible to consider the
act consensual.  Both you and your partner or partners have the right to say no
to something that makes them feel uncomfortable!</p>

<p>More importantly, there are some things that consent is definitely not:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Never implied</strong> - it's always good to talk through what
    one wants to do with one's partner or partners, and assuming implied consent
    can be very hurtful to them.</li>
    <li><strong>Cannot be assumed</strong> - assuming consent based on certain
    behaviors or due to history does not mean that consent is given.  Talk it
    through with those you're intimate with and make sure everything is
    okay![<a href="#ref2" id="deref2">2</a>]</li>
    <li>And, more pertinently, <strong>costumes are not consent</strong> -
    someone in a fursuit or cosplay gear still has the right to give or revoke
    consent, and it's always good to ask!</li>
</ul>
Consent is a very important aspect to healthy sexual interaction.  It's a
process of negotiation that must take place between you and those to whom you
are intimate: knowing about other partners, knowing about STD status, and
knowing what's okay to do in order to keep everyone healthy and happy. After
healthy sex means healthy in both mental and emotional aspects!</p>

<h3>Protection</h3>

<p>Sex goes beyond just consent, though, and there are a number of reasons which
one should practice safe sex with one's partner or partners:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Contraception</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Trust</strong></li>
</ul>


<h4>Male condoms</h4>

<p>Latex male condoms are one of the best ways to prevent both STDs and unwanted
pregnancy between you and your partner or partners. [<a href="#ref3"

<h4>Dental dams and other forms of barrier protection</h4>
