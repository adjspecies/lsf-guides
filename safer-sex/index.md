title: The Love ◦ Sex ◦ Fur Guide to Safer Sex
---

Welcome to the **<span class="titlefont">Love ◦ Sex ◦ Fur</span> Guide
to Safer Sex**! Our goal is to provide a simple manual to help you enjoy
a sexual lifestyle that's safe and healthy for both you and your partner
or partners. We'll be covering the topics of consent, protection, and
contraception in a clear and topical manner to help you make healthy and
informed choices. This guide will be available online in a
mobile-friendly format, as well as available in print so that it's
always there to be referenced. Additionally, we will endeavor to keep
this up to date with the US Center for Disease Control's information on
sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy so that we never fall
behind.

### Talking About Sex

Here in the furry subculture, sex and sexuality play a unique role for a
few reasons:

-   **We produce and consume art of all sorts of a sexual nature** -
    visual arts, written erotica, and even videos involving live actors
    in costume.
-   **We interact with each other through constructed characters** -
    there's more to each fur than meets the eye, as many of us interact
    in the ways in which we choose: through constructed characters.
-   **We are pretty honest about sex and sexuality** - the furry
    subculture is seen by many as a safe space for exploring and
    re-evaluating topics such as sex, sexual orientation, and
    gender identity. \[<span id="deref1">[1](#ref1)</span>\]

Given these reasons, and many more to boot, it's no surprise that the
topic of sex comes up often with regards to furry life and social
interaction!

This guide is intended to be a sex-positive map for navigating the
waters of sexuality in the furry fandom. What is meant by
sex-positivity?

-   **Sex-positivity is not hypersexuality** - by providing a positive
    face to sex and sexuality, the goal is not to encourage sex, but to
    encourage acceptance of sex, lack of sex, lots and lots of sex, and
    all different stripes in between.
-   **A positive and constructive experience** - sex and the discussion
    around sex should always be positive and constructive, never
    shameful or leave one feeling bad about oneself!
-   **The most important discussion is between you and your partner or
    partners** - guides like this are good at providing you with the
    information you need to have healthy and safe sex, but the ultimate
    conversation should be one that you have with those closest to you!

Why do we need a sex-positive guide to safer sex, then? The goal is
simple: more information is always better. We here in the fandom have
the right and responsibility to make the best and safest decisions for
ourselves in the ways we interact with each other. Standing by that
principle, guides like this one right here need to provide accurate and
up-to-date information to help make this conversation possible.

### Consent

All sexual activity that you share with another person or other people
must involve consent, and that often takes the part of a conversation
you have with someone when you are ready to become intimate with each
other. Consent is, simply, a willing and mutual agreement to take part
in this act together. However, it's worth dissecting just what that
means:

-   **It's voluntary** - consent is never coerced from your partner;
    it's the type of thing that only they can give.
-   **It's active** - consent means saying yes, even enthusiastically!
    There should be no doubt that your partner consents!
-   **It's continual** - it doesn't matter what's gone on before between
    you and your partner: your sexual history, your life history, or
    even what you've done already that evening, consent is given or not
    for everything you do. If someone says "NO!" then it's time to stop.

Without all of these being taken into account, it's not possible to
consider the act consensual. Both you and your partner or partners have
the right to say no to something that makes them feel uncomfortable!

More importantly, there are some things that consent is definitely not:

-   **Never implied** - it's always good to talk through what one wants
    to do with one's partner or partners, and assuming implied consent
    can be very hurtful to them.
-   **Cannot be assumed** - assuming consent based on certain behaviors
    or due to history does not mean that consent is given. Talk it
    through with those you're intimate with and make sure everything is
    okay!\[<span id="deref2">[2](#ref2)</span>\]
-   And, more pertinently, **costumes are not consent** - someone in a
    fursuit or cosplay gear still has the right to give or revoke
    consent, and it's always good to ask!

Consent is a very important aspect to healthy sexual interaction. It's a
process of negotiation that must take place between you and those with
whom you are intimate: knowing about other partners, knowing about STD
status, and knowing what's okay to do in order to keep everyone healthy
and happy. After all healthy sex means healthy in physical, mental, and
emotional aspects!

### Protection

Sex goes beyond just consent, though, and there are a number of reasons
which one should practice safe sex with one's partner or partners:

-   **Preventing Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs)** - more than just
    a simple cold, STDs can be serious diseases and infections that can
    be life-threatening if not treated. Some, such as HIV, do not yet
    have a cure and remain with you for the rest of your life.
-   **Contraception** - beyond just helping prevent the transmission of
    STDs, the protection methods below are also effective at preventing
    unwanted pregnancies.
-   **Trust** - discussing and using protection with your partner or
    partners builds the level of trust within your relationship and
    helps make sex a positive and less-risky endeavor!

#### Male condoms

Correctly used, latex male condoms are one of the best ways to prevent
both STDs and unwanted pregnancy between you and your partner or
partners. \[<span id="deref3">[3](#ref3)</span>, <span
id="deref4">[4](#ref4)</span>\]. It's important to stay safe, after all!
Condoms should be used for penetrative sex of all types, whether it's a
penis, a toy, or fingers - they work equally well for all cases!

To correctly use a male condom:

1.  First, check the expiration date and make sure the condom is still
    good to use! Condoms weaken with age, and also with heat, so make
    sure to store them somewhere other than a wallet or glove-box
2.  Squeeze the condom down to one side of the package and tear open on
    the other.
3.  Remove the condom from the package and, optionally, add a bit of
    lube to the inside of the tip (the inside is the side *without* the
    rolled edge).
4.  Pinching the tip of the condom, place it over the tip of the
    erection or toy to be used and roll it carefully down - pinching the
    tip maintains a reservoir for semen, in the case of an erection.
5.  Once done, carefully slide the condom off and throw it away in the
    trash - never use the toilet! A new condom should be used for
    every act.

#### Dental dams and other forms of barrier protection

Male condoms don't fit every scenario, however. It's always good to be
safe no matter the act, however, so it's best to keep a barrier of some
sort in place for all different sorts of acts. These mostly include
dental dams and latex gloves

Dental dams are flat sheets of latex normally used in oral sex of some
sort. They are excellent for both cunnilingus and oral-anal stimulation
(or rimming). If you do not have one available, one may be constructed
by cutting a condom or latex glove down one side and flattening it out.

Insertable or "female" condoms are also an option. These consist of a
looser latex sleeve with two rubber rings which help to hold it into a
cylindrical shape. The closed end is inserted in to the body (either the
vaginal canal or the anus) and then the penis is inserted into the
provided latex. Lube may be used to help out in this case.

Simple latex gloves can be used during manual stimulation to avoid
direct contact. There are several instances where one might use latex
gloves when playing with one's partner or partners:

-   If one has also used their hand for stimulating oneself or others -
    this reduces the potential for fluid transfer.
-   If one has cuts or abrasions, new tattoos, or piercings on their
    hands - this reduces any contact with a break in the natural barrier
    of the skin.
-   If one is allergic to lubricants - you can use any non-oil based
    lubricants with latex gloves (note that oil-based lubricants will
    weaken latex gloves just as they will weaken condoms!).

#### PrEP

PrEP stands for "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis" and indicates a set of drugs
taken to combat HIV before infection can take place <span
id="deref5">[\[5\]](#ref5)</span>. It is used in individuals who are at
risk of acquiring HIV and consists of some of the medications used for
those who have already contracted HIV. The idea is that it is used to
prevent the virus from ever having the chance to take hold in the body.

PrEP, like condom use, is one of those things that is only effective
when taken properly and consistently. Missing doses can reduce the
effectiveness of the medicines.

Should you still use a condom whenever possible while on PrEP?
Absolutely! PrEP is intended for use with condoms. PrEP does not protect
against pregnancy or other STDs, and PrEP is a means of insurance, not a
guarantee. It is intended for those who are not mutually monogamous and
also have any amount of unprotected sex. Additionally, it may be used in
monogamous relationships when one partner is HIV positive and the other
is negative, and may help prevent babies from contracting HIV in the
womb.

Additionally, there are some other tasks involved in taking PrEP than
simply taking a pill a day. You must get tested for HIV and other STDs
once every three to six months even if no symptoms are present. PrEP
isn't for everyone, but may provide additional reassurance around HIV
for the sexually active among us

#### Alternatives to penetrative sex

The CDC and many programs across the United States advocate abstinence
as the safest form of sex - after all, if you're not in sexual contact,
you're sure unlikely to contract any STDs! However, if you do wish to be
sexually active, there are still activities that can take place between
you and your partner or partners that are much safer by virtue of not
involving penetration.

-   **Manual** - Manual stimulation such as mutual masturbation with
    your partner or partners present, or manually stimulating your
    partner or partners.
-   **Mammary, intercrural, intergluteal, or axillary sex** -
-   **Grinding or *Frottage*** - Rubbing or grinding against your
    partner or partners (note that frottage sometimes carries the
    connotation of non-consensual, which is obviously not the
    intent here!).
-   **Toys**
-   **Massage, kissing, and sensual touch** -

Sex and sexuality are a normal and pleasurable part of life. We are
wired to enjoy sexual interaction and many within the furry subculture
embrace this. With the knowledge of informed consent and the tools of
safer sex, you and your partner or partners can enjoy a healthy,
sexually active lifestyle.

### Glossary

Consent
:   Consent means that all parties involved are willing to participate
    in an act with each other; an agreement and consensus among
    all parties.

Contraception
:   Any form of birth control, meant to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
    Contraception is not necessarily protection against STDs.

Dental dam
:   A flat piece of latex used as a barrier during oral sex to prevent
    fluid exchange through the mouth.

Latex
:   A thin, pliable rubber used to make condoms, dental dams, and rubber
    gloves; if one is allergic to latex, alternative materials are
    available!

Lubricant or lube
:   A material, usually a liquid, cream or gel, used to reduce friction
    during a sexual act. **Note:** oil-based lubricants are not
    compatible with latex condoms or gloves, and silicone lubricants are
    not compatible with silicone-based toys - be careful to only use an
    appropriate lubricant.

Safe Word
:   A mutually agreed upon word or phrase used to stop everything. This
    is usually "no", "stop", or anything along those lines.

Sex
:   Any act, not necessarily involving penetration, involving two or
    more people in a sexual context (basically: masturbation gets its
    own guide!).

Sex-positivity
:   The idea that sex and the conversation surrounding it should not be
    negative experiences.

STD (or STI)
:   Sexually Transmitted Diseases (or Infections; we use the CDC term
    of Diseases) such as HIV, herpes, gonorrhea, and several others.
